# Responsive Web Page Design with CSS and HTML

## Overview

This project is a responsive web page that adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes. The design focuses on a hero section featuring an image and accompanying text content. The hero image dynamically resizes while maintaining alignment with the text content as the window size changes, ensuring a consistent layout on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Layout:** The page is fully responsive and adjusts based on screen size.
- **Hero Image:** The image in the hero section adapts to window resizing, maintaining a proper aspect ratio and alignment with the content.
- **Text Content:** The hero content stays aligned and positioned alongside the image, even during window resizing.
- **Flexbox & Positioning:** Flexbox is used for layout flexibility, ensuring that both image and text remain well-positioned.
- **Modern CSS Practices:** Uses modern CSS features like `object-fit` for image resizing and `flex` for layout control.

## File Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML file that contains the basic structure of the webpage.
- `style.css` - The CSS file that handles the layout, responsiveness, and styling of the page.
  
## Responsive Behavior

- **Desktop View:** The hero image covers the full width, and the content stays aligned at the top.
- **Mobile View:** The layout adjusts for smaller screens by resizing the hero image and content appropriately.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the webpage.

3. Resize the browser window to observe the responsive behavior of the hero section.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - For structuring the page content.
- **CSS3** - For styling and responsive design, using Flexbox and positioning.
  
## Future Improvements

- Further enhancements to mobile responsiveness, including better scaling of images and content.
